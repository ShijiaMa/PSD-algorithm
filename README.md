**Basic content**: Provide code for PSD measurement of porous geotechnical materials based on two-dimensional or three-dimensional microscopic imagesï¼Œ Used for microstructure characterization.

**Basic principle of use**: Firstly, select an appropriate image threshold segmentation method to segment the obtained microscopic image into a binary image of pore matrix. Then, apply the calculation code (Psd2D. m file corresponds to 2D image, Psd3D. m file corresponds to 3D image) and fill in the corresponding parameters according to the comments. The corresponding PSD measurement results can be obtained from this. It is worth noting that before running, the folder stored in the code needs to be added to the search path of the MATLAB software.
